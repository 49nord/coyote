coyote: Automatic let's encrypt / ACME certificate renewal
==========================================================

`coyote` renews [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates
automatically using the ACME protocol. It only performs the necessary steps to
renew the certificates, and is usually used in tandem with systemd and nginx.


Quick start

TBW


Command-line use
----------------

`coyote` takes domains to renew as command-line arguments (you can list
multiple):

```
coyote mydomain.example.com [...]
```

Once started, it will first check if a certificate file named
`/etc/ssl/mydomain.example.com.crt` exists. If it does and its expiration date
is at least 30 days in the future, no action will be taken.

If the certificate does not exist or will expire soon, `coyote` will generate a
new keypair (stored as **`/etc/ssl/private/mydomain.example.com.pem`** for the
private key and `/etc/ssl/mydomain.example.com.crt` for the public key),
generate a certificate signing request (`/etc/coyote/mydomain.example.com.csr`)
and use these items to create a new certificate signed by let's encrypt.

The resulting certificate will be stored as
**`/etc/ssl/mydomain.example.com.crt`**, a chain version is available at
**`/etc/ssl/mydomain.example.com.chain.crt`**.

Security
--------

*coyote* has three dependencies: [acme-tiny](https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny), [requests](docs.python-requests.org/)
and OpenSSL. *acme-tiny* is meant to be reviewed personally, though it is also installable as a Debian packages called
[acme-tiny](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=acme-tiny). *requests* can be installed on Debian in the form of
[python3-requests](https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&searchon=names&keywords=python3-requests). Alternatively it can also be installed "manually" using virtualenv.

Since *coyote* is a single file executable, it can and should also be reviewed manually, similar to *acme-tiny*.
